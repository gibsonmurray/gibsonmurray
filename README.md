My name is **Gibson Murray** and I am a current **Computer Science** major at the **University of Maryland, College Park** :crab:
This github page is for housing previous and current projects that I will primarily use for personal and professional use :space_invader:	
I am currently applying for internships and various positions so if you are looking for my work you are in the right place :smile:
